For the last few weeks, Facebook has been shoving their version of what they think my year looked like in my face. Rather than share what their [shitty, soulless algorithm](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/12/24/inadvertent-algorithmic-cruelty/) thinks about how 2014 was for me, I wanted to put it in my own words and pictures; because that's the only way to adequately capture it.

I'll start off by saying that 2014 has been the best year of my life in _so_ many ways. When I sat down to think back on all that has happened, there are three dates this year that really stick out to me. Three dates that sum up just how incredible this year has been for me.

### On February 9, she said "yes."

Brenna and I were on a weekend vacation to New York City and, despite the freezing cold, were wandering around  Midtown and the Upper East Side. What she didn't know at the time was that I had brought along a ring and had it tucked away in my jacket pocket, waiting for just the right moment.

Around midday, we found ourselves on the Gapstow Bridge in Central Park - when I decided to pop the question. She said "yes."

### On June 23, I started at 10up.

It's sort of a funny juxtaposition - to sandwich this between two of the biggest days of my entire life - but working at 10up has truly been a turning point for me in my career.

Prior to joining 10up, I had never worked with any other engineers; I was always the only one. Now, I'm fortunate enough to spend my days working with one of the most talented engineering teams in the world.

I've learned more than I thought possible in my first six months and continue to learn more and more every day.

### On December 7, we were married.

Though our _actual _wedding isn't until March, Brenna and I decided to also have a small, intimate Justice of the Peace ceremony with only our parents and closest friends. So, on December 7, she officially made me the luckiest guy ever.

### Looking Forward

Looking back on this year, it's hard to imagine things getting any better - I married my dream girl and landed by dream job - but there are big things on the horizon for us still.

All in all, I'm truly thankful for the way this year has gone and am incredibly optimistic about the year to come.
